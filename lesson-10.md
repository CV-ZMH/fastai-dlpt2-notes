# Lesson 10
- (off topic) Jeremy uses software called OBS for recording classes.
    - Streaming key from youtube is linked
- well be using pytorch-ninghtly
- Sharing unpublished research

## Wrapping up our CNN
- Remember, this is meatnt to take a while, don't worry
  - try to make us busy until next year
  - don't feel like you have to understand everything
  - covering more software engineering
  - DS need to be also software engineers

### What do we mean by from the foundations?
- Recreate fastai
- using python, non ds modules, pytorch, 
- but well make it better

### Steps to a basic modern CNN model
- matmul > ..
### Today were going to start move from a minimal training loop to something that is SoTA on Imagenet
- Cuda, convolutions, hooks, normalization, transforms, weight decay, label smoothin, Optimization, skip connection architectures
- or at least pretty close
- google skipped using LAMB
- Paper? 
- LAMB is a general optimizer that works for both small and large batch

### Next week well learn how to develop a complete new module fastai.audio
- module creation, jupyter docs, writing tests, complex numbers, fourier transforms, audio formats, spectrograms, nonimage transforms, gated CNNs

### Well also learn about sequence to sequence models with attention
- neural translation
seq2seq

### Well wrap up python adventures with a dive din to u nets, plos some more vision applications
- build your own dl box
- fasttec 2
- U-net deev dipe
- Pixel shuffle
- Self-attention
- Learnable blurring
- Generative video models
- Devise
- CycleGan
- Object detection
